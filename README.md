## Overview

The face detection project utilizes computer vision libraries like OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces in images and video streams. The project uses the Haar cascade classifier provided by OpenCV for face detection. However, you can also explore other deep learning-based models like SSD or YOLO for more accurate and robust face detection.
